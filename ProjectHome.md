Google Code is closing and the PRANK homepage has been moved onto a new server.

The new address of the PRANK homepage is  **[http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank](http://wasabiapp.org/software/prank)**. That page contains instructions for the installation and use of PRANK and links to the latest versions of binary packages.


The latest source code can be obtained from [GitHub](https://github.com/ariloytynoja/prank-msa). Comments and bug reports can be entered through [the Issues page](https://github.com/ariloytynoja/prank-msa/issues).
