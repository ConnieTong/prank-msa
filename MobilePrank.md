## New feature: mobile PRANK ##

If one **really** needs phylogenetic MSA on the go, there's now an option for that and one can run PRANK on Nokia N9 mobile phones. See [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/prank-msa/downloads/list) for the deb-package. The package manager installs the binary to `/opt/prank/bin/prank` which is not on the standard search path. To execute the program (within Terminal), one either has to specify the full path or move the binary to another location.
